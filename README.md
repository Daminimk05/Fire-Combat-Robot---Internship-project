# 🔥 Fire Combat Robot

## Internship Project

## Project Description
The **Fire Combat Robot** is an autonomous robotic system designed to detect and control fire with minimal human intervention. The robot uses **IR sensors** to identify the presence of fire and navigate toward the source. Once fire is detected, a **fan-based extinguishing mechanism** is activated to suppress the flames.

The system is controlled by an **Arduino UNO**, which processes sensor inputs and manages motor movement and fire-extinguishing actions through a motor driver and relay module. This project demonstrates practical implementation of **embedded systems, sensor interfacing, and motor control**, with potential applications in fire safety and automation.

## Aim
To build a fire combat robot that can automatically detect fire and extinguish it by activating a fan mechanism, while navigating toward the fire source using sensors.

---

## Working Principle
1. IR sensors continuously monitor the environment for fire.
2. When fire is detected, the robot stops moving.
3. The fan is activated using a relay module to extinguish the fire.
4. If no fire is detected, the robot continues to move forward.
